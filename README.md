TO-DO Notes - Code for 5.1-5.3 Testing Codelab
============================================================================

Code for the Advanced Android Kotlin Testing Codelab 5.1-5.3

Build Config Setup
------------------
For whoever tried to download from original repo, try to downgrade the gradle into the old version one (in this case the gradle 7.4.2) to sync the project. Next, you can use the AGP Upgrade Assistant, to update to the latest or stable one. 

I think by default the Java version of Compilation will be around Java 8 which is not suitable for the Gradle 8.xx. Try to change the Java Compilation and also try to update the Kotlin version and some important dependencies.

Also note, for older dependencies, sometimes when building process, it will throw non-sense error, but try some simple solution just upgrade the dependencies related to the error to the latest or stable one.

Also run the test with the Gradle, the JUnit was trash for running test. 

Introduction
------------

TO-DO Notes is an app where you to write down tasks to complete. The app displays them in a list.
You can then mark them as completed or not, filter them and delete them.

This codelab has four branches, representing different code states:

* [starter_code](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-testing/tree/starter_code)
* [end_codelab_1](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-testing/tree/end_codelab_1)
* [end_codelab_2](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-testing/tree/end_codelab_2)
* [end_codelab_3](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-testing/tree/end_codelab_3)

The codelabs in this series are:
* [Testing Basics](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-testing-basics)
* [Introduction to Test Doubles and Dependency Injection](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-testing-test-doubles)
* [Survey of Testing Topics](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-testing-survey)


Pre-requisites
--------------

You should be familiar with:

* The Kotlin programming language, including [Kotlin coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) and their interaction with [Android Jetpack components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines).
* The following core Android Jetpack libraries: [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel),
 [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata),
  [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) and 
  [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding).
* Application architecture, following the pattern from the [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide) and [Android Fundamentals codelabs](https://developer.android.com/courses/kotlin-android-fundamentals/toc).


Getting Started
---------------

1. Download and run the app.
